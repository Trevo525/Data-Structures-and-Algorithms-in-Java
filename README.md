# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java
I did [this course](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-deep-dive-using-java/) on Udemy. This is the project files I created following the course. 

After making this app in Java I created it in C#. This can be found [here](https://github.com/Trevo525/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms).
